# Alexa Sonoff Skill
This Alexa skill is hosted on a lambda function and uses the Ewelink API to toggle a sonoff wifi switch on/off.  
NOTE: index.js will need to be edited with your proper ewelink email and password before using. 
## Goals
- I would like to build this out to be a "command cetner" for many devices in my home, especially for taking temperatures. 
- I would also like to build a simple web-app that shows real-time graphs of the different temperatures as they update on a time interval (every 15 mins or so)
